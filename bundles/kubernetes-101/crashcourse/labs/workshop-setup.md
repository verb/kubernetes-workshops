#### Provision Kubernetes using Google Container Engine (GKE)

Kubernetes can be configured with many options and add-ons, but can be time consuming to bootstrap from the ground up. In this section you will bootstrap Kubernetes using [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine) (GKE).

In your **Cloud Shell** terminal, issue the following commands (feel free to change the zone or cluster name):

```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b
gcloud container clusters create k8s-101
gcloud container clusters get-credentials k8s-101
```
