# Kubernetes 101 Crash Course

In this crash course you'll learn to deploy existing applications on a
[Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine) cluster.

This is a modified version of the [Kubernetes 101 Workshop](../workshop) written
by [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower). Use that one
instead. It's better.

There are also [slides with speaker notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KBZK_OiP9VyBqSG0xMN6vuVO2fH97uUO7AnhfDxti94/edit?usp=sharing).

## Workshop Setup

Complete the steps in [Workshop Setup](labs/workshop-setup.md) prior to the
start of the course.

## Labs

The labs in this crash course are intended to give a quick tour of basic
Kubernetes operations.

1. [Creating and managing pods](labs/creating-and-managing-pods.md)
2. [Creating and managing deployments](labs/creating-and-managing-deployments.md)
3. [Creating and managing services](labs/creating-and-managing-services.md)

## Next Steps
